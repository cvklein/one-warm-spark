title: One Warm Spark

I'm Colin Klein. By day I'm a philosopher at the [Australian National University](https://philosophy.cass.anu.edu.au). You can find my contact information and professional profile at my [home page](https://www.colinklein.org/).

This is an experiment in old-fashioned blogging. In practice, mostly occasional writing, stuff I enjoyed reading, and self-promotion.
