title: One Warm Spark
---

I'm Colin Klein. By day I'm a philosopher at the [Australian National University](https://philosophy.cass.anu.edu.au). You can find my professional profile at my [home page](https://www.colinklein.org/). This is for miscellaneous leftovers and rants--the collapse of social media hasn't kept me from wanting to ramble. In practice mostly writing warmups.
